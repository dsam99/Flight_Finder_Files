Problems we are looking to solve:

Hungry passengers on a flight:
-> User: people who are busy and must eat during a flight

Ideas: 

Web-App
	Pre-ordering food/drinks on flights for cheaper prices
	Shows listings on flights
	Gives query about pre-ordering food or drinks
	Discounts for people who fly often/buy often
	Can specify what hour/time in flight when food can arrive


Machine Learning using Jet Blue Flight Data
	Match data
	Find "hot" times of flying (time or date)
	Return for location or destination


Facebook API and Jet Blue Data
	Enter your flight number
	Login into Facebook network
	Return in any and which friends are going on the flight


Chrome Extensions (multiple possibilities)
	Bookmark manager
	Fake news/credibility
	Finding most important parts of page/articles
