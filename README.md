We are creating a web app that utilizes a Jet Blue data set to generate a random trip. When entering a certain range of free time, our web app will generate a random trip with flight data to a certain city or country. The app can also account for price ranges, language constraints, and other parameters. 

The app will also output information about the destination with the trip details. It can output the language, landmarks, and more about the location. 

The user can also "reshuffle" the location a couple times to possibly find a more ideal destination, but the main purpose of the web app is to promote the learning and exploration of a new location.
